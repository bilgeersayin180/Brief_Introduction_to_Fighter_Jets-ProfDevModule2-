# Brief_Introduction_to_Fighter_Jets-ProfDevModule2-

Description of the Project:
To deepen my understanding of avionics, particularly focusing on the working principles of fighter jets, by Using Processing 4.3, I developed an animation aimed at briefly teaching these principles. This included topics such as how planes achieve lift during flight and how jet engines operate.

Installation of the Project: 
Since my animation are made in Processing 4.3, Processing 4.3 has to be installed. (https://processing.org/download)
As the apporiate Processing 4.3 is installed according to the operating system of your computer from the link given above, you can download the zip.
As you download and then extract the zip file, you will see that it contains three files of my animations with the order; introduction, content 1 and content 2.

For each animation, just click on the file of the animation and open the Processing 4.3 program of the animation. As you open the Processing 4.3 program,
you will notice a triangle inside circle at top left. Click on that to start playing the animation and enjoy!
